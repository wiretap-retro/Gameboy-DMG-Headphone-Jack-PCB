# Gameboy DMG Headphone Jack PCB
A replacement Gameboy DMG headphone jack PCB utilizing all newly manufactured parts -- yes, even the jack.

## Intro
To start off, one of my orginal Gameboys has headphone jack issues, and no amount of cleaning fixed it. I tried every YouTube tutorial, forum advice, Discord advice, etc. Surely, someone has to have made a near OEM style replacement right? I guess not. Every replacement board I could find uses the old Gameboy DMG headphone jack. I did find one completely new design in the Super DMG 01, but that strays too far from OEM and has a lot of unnecessary parts if you just want a cheap and simple replacement. \

After work one day, I decided to take a look at what made people keep using the original corroding jacks on replacement boards. Was it the size / form factor of finding the right replacement? Maybe. Was it confusing to figure out? Apparently. I found all sorts of weird pinouts people tried to draw, people claiming the audio was looping through the jack and back to the speaker, and arguing back and forth over drawing diagrams of how it works. It even confused me, because some people claimed to be confidently correct, then would be proven wrong by someone else. I decided to step back and look at the original Gameboy DMG schematic.
